## Last Week's Accomplishments

> PHP && Python bridge added

> Chromedriver linked

## This Week's Plan

> Data Structure for our database has conflict with the back end. We need to decide whether to change the structure completely or modify the back end logic which may cause the front end data modification.

> still rm some old unused modules
